# microgradWL

This repo implements [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) as a WL paclet.

### Motivation
I recently started watching the nn-zero-to-zero series by @karpathy. I just finished the [first video](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0) building micrograd from scratch and thought the natural exercise for me was to try implementing it in the WL.

One can call python from the WL, but the purpose of this paclet is to implement micrograd in a WL style, and compare that implementation with the WL `Net*` functions, similar to how Andrej compares micrograd functionality to pytorch.
